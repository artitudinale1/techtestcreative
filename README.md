#<b>Technical test - Creative</b>#

##<b>BRIEF/BACKGOUND PROJECT</b>##

This is a technical test I took as part of the recruiment process for an Digital Healcare Company based in London.
The test had two part :  a creative part and a creation of a validated form I stored in this other repo. https://github.com/artitudinale1/techtestForm

Creative license. A large part of your role will be introducing finishing touches to interfaces that cannot be conveyed in flat design files. 

Please see the 'Nav.psd' file in the 'Creative' folder supplied with this test package. Using any of the following technologies (HTML,CSS,JavaScript), reproduce the navigation bar illustrated in the 'Nav.psd' file. Feel free to use your creativity and imagination to add any additional effects / design touches.

If you don't have photoshop, use an alternative such as Gimp or Pixelmator. Failing that we have included a JPG as a build reference.

Key files: Nav.psd , Nav.jpg

##<b>DESCRIPTION</b>##

One page liquid/responsive layout.

I've interpreted the functionality as an accordion menu.

I was attracted by the numbers next to each tabs and I wanted give dynamic values so I just linked those to counters of hits on the same tabs.
